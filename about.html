         	<p>
         	Hi, I'm Moniruzzaman. You can call me Monir, that is my nick name 
            actually. I don't have a lastname in my school certificate, so sometimes I split my name as Monir Zaman then I can use my last name as Zaman when it is needed for registering online to create a profile instead writing 'No Last Name'.  
         	</p>

            <p>I first jumped into programming in 2007, but I lack consistency through the journy of being skilled. I've gone through many stuffs and jumped into one thing to another. That makes me late to become master at something.

            </p>

         	<p> I have passion for analysing problem and passion for technology since my childhood. Building new tools was my real hobby, in fact still I have.</p> 

         	<p>I was born in 80's so yes I was into that analog electronics stuffs, fixing radio,TV or sometimes just for curiosity what's going on inside or how does it work, and then the device is broken! </p> 

         	<p>I've grew up with experiment of fixing, breaking and creating electronic tools and devices</p>

         	<p>It's quite obvious that someone interested in solving problems or like to think about solution of a problem and then he gets a computer, his next move will be into programming. But it was late to have a computer for me</p>  

            <p>During my diploma in engineering I got my first computer and started learning programming. My first line of code was written in C</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I've been consistent with programming for more than three years now.
            </p> 

            <p>For professional work I work with PHP and JavaScript mostly and I write code in C, Python for experiment and diving into low level programming</p>
